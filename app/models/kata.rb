# Kata represents the exercises to improve the software craftsmanship.
# The word 'kata' and 'exercise' refers to the same thing and they are interchangeable.
# Kata used to be an inherited class of Post. But now they are separate models as it's preferred
# to store them in different collections.
# Kata operations are managed by PostController because they share many operations and information in common.

  # This method is to retrieve all reviews that are not deleted.
  # Thanks to Mongoid's extra Paranoia, deletion becomes soft delete so all deleted reviews are
  # still in database. However, Mongoid 2 is only able to retrieve all items (normal and deleted) if
  # items are in a sub-collection (reviews) under one collection (katas).
  # To retrieve only the normal items (non-deleted), this method is used. If update to Mongoid 3, this
